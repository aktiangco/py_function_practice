## Functions Practice

At this point, you should feel confident that you can create a Python file and run it from your terminal. We will be utilizing this skill in the next portion of the activity.

This activity is not designed to trick you or confuse you in any way. Rather, it is designed to help you gain confidence that the skills you've already learned and practiced in Replit can be applied in Python programming on your personal computer as well.

Follow the steps below to create a Python file which you will submit to your instructor.- In your Python projects folder, create a new file called functions_practice.py.

- Open your file in VSCode, and create the following functions:
- A function named hello() that prints a greeting to the user. This function should accept no arguments and returns nothing.
  - A function named pack() that accepts three arguments, and returns a single list with the three arguments inside as list elements.
  - A function called eat_lunch(). This function should accept a list of any length, and print out a series of strings that say "First I eat __" (the first element of the list), and "Next I eat ___" (for the following elements in the list). If the list is empty, print "My lunchbox is empty!". The function should not return anything.
- Test that your file works by running it in your terminal. Remember, you need to call your functions in order for them to run. Make sure that all three functions run (please print the output of pack()) before submitting the file.
